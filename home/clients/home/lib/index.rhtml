<% # SPROUTCORE DEFAULT INDEX TEMPLATE 
   # This template provide provides a basic wrapper for a SproutCore client.
   # Most of the time, it will be sufficient for your own needs.  However, if
   # you need to create your own template, you can do so by copying this file
   # into your client, naming it 'index.rhtml' and then adding the options
   # :index => 'index' to your client declaration in routes.rb.
   #
   # See the comments in this file for more information on what you can
   # change.
