Developing on iVolunteer

We're using git for revision control, you need to ensure you have a client installed
to develop on iVolunteer. See http://git-scm.com/download for a download.

On a mac, my experience has been that using MacPorts http://www.macports.org/ is the
easiest way to get git (as well as a number of other useful apps).

iPhone App:
  You need the latest iPhone SDK: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/download.html

Website:

  We're using SporutCore as a javascript framework for the front-end on the application.
    - Development requires Ruby and RubyGems
    - Framework installation instructions http://www.sproutcore.com/download/

Getting the code:
  Code is on github
    - Project Page: http://github.com/daveangulo/ivolunteer/tree/master
    - Public Clone URL: git://github.com/daveangulo/ivolunteer.git
